## Bench Power Supplies Labels for Retro Systems

![logo](logo.png)

Those are simple labels to attach to home-made power cables, mostly for
retro consoles and computers that aren't powered by mains cables.

I usually go to my electronics store with the item that I want to power,
and come back out with a barrel plug to solder, and some screw-on banana
plugs. The screw-on banana plugs go in my bench power supply, the connector
to the piece of equipment I want to power, with the polarity and voltage
easy to double-check on the label.

One cable per connector and voltage combination. This avoids problems where
you might think a voltage is for one piece of equipment on the label, but
it's actually for another.

The label was created using Inkscape, the logos from various places around the
Internet, with fair use as the reason for inclusion.
